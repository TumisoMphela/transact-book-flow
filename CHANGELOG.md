### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure

#### Performance
- Added database indexes on:
  - user_roles (user_id, role)
  - session_events (booking_id)
  - material_downloads (material_id, user_id)
  - materials (approval_status)
  - bookings (status, session_date)
  - stripe_events (stripe_event_id)

#### Database Functions
- `has_role()` - Secure role checking
- `get_user_roles()` - Retrieve user's roles array
- Updated `handle_new_user()` - Assigns roles on signup

### üîß Configuration

#### Supabase Functions
All edge functions are auto-deployed and include:
- CORS support for web requests
- Proper authentication checks
- Error handling and logging
- Idempotent operations where applicable

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes
- `user_type` field in profiles is now deprecated in favor of `user_roles` table
- `is_approved` field in materials replaced with `approval_status`
- Material visibility now strictly controlled by approval workflow
- Admin access now requires role in `user_roles` table

### üîÑ Migration Notes

#### For Existing Users
Existing users will have their roles automatically assigned based on their `user_type` via the updated `handle_new_user()` trigger.

To manually migrate existing users:
```sql
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
SELECT user_id, user_type::app_role
FROM profiles
WHERE user_type IN ('admin', 'tutor', 'student')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

#### For Existing Materials
Existing materials need approval status migration:
```sql
UPDATE materials
SET approval_status = CASE
  WHEN is_approved = true THEN 'approved'
  ELSE 'pending'
END
WHERE approval_status IS NULL;
```

### üìä Platform Warnings
Two platform-level security recommendations from Supabase:
1. **Enable leaked password protection** in Auth settings
2. **Upgrade Postgres version** for latest security patches

These are not critical but should be addressed in the Supabase dashboard.

### üéØ Next Steps (Phase 4 - Future)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add E2E testing with Playwright/Cypress
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Add rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add email notifications for material approval
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard
- [ ] Add bulk operations for admins
- [ ] Implement search optimization
- [ ] Add real-time notifications
